In today’s technological conditions, new data are being produced by different sources in
many sectors. However, it is not possible to extract the useful information hidden in these
data sets, unless they are processed properly. In order to find out these hidden information,
various analyses should be performed using data mining, which consists of numerous
methods.The Churn Analysis aims to predict customers who are going to stop
using a product or service among the customers. And, the customer churn analysis is a
data mining based work that will extract these possibilities. Today’s competitive
conditions led to numerous companies selling the same product at quite a similar service
and product quality. With the Churn Analysis, it is possible to precisely predict the
customers who are going to stop using services or products by assigning a probability to
each customer. This analysis can be performed according to customer segments and
amount of loss (monetary equivalent). Following these analyses, communication with the
customers can be improved in order to persuade the customers and increase customer
loyalty. Effective marketing campaigns for target customers can be created by calculating
the churn rate or customer attrition. In this way, profitability can be increased significantly
or the possible damage due to customer loss can be reduced at the same rate. For example,
if a service provider which has a total of 2 million subscribers, gains 750.000 new
subscribers and lost 275.000 customers; churn rate is calculated as 10%. The customer
churn rate has a significant effect on the financial market value of the company. So most
of the companies keep an eye on the value of the customer at monthly or quarterly
periods.
